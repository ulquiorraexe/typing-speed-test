# Typing Speed Test

This is a Python project that uses the Tkinter library to create a Typing Speed Test application. The app allows the user to test their typing speed by typing random words as quickly and accurately as possible. The result is displayed in words per minute (WPM).

## Features

- A user-friendly GUI built using the Tkinter library.
- Randomly generated words for the typing test.
- Real-time calculation of typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
- Instant feedback if the typed word is correct or incorrect.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python installed on your machine. The required libraries are Tkinter and time, which come pre-installed with Python.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ulquiorraexe/typing-speed-test.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd typing-speed-test

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python main.py

## How It Works

### Step 1: Launch the Application
When you run the script, the application window will open, displaying a random word that you need to type.

### Step 2: Start Typing
Click the "Start Test" button to begin. Start typing the word displayed on the screen in the input box. The application will begin calculating your typing speed.

### Step 3: Get Results
Once you type the word correctly and press "Enter," the application will show your typing speed in words per minute (WPM). If you make a mistake, it will display "Incorrect! Try again" in red, and you can continue typing.

### Step 4: Try Again
The application will display a new word after each attempt, and you can continue testing your typing speed.

### Example Flow:
1. Click "Start Test."
2. Type the word that appears on the screen.
3. Press "Enter" to submit.
4. View the result: WPM or incorrect feedback.
5. Repeat as desired.

This simple yet effective design helps users improve their typing speed over time.
